NEXT STEPS FOR SUNFISH TRAINING
================================

ISSUE: I was using the old checkpoint (last.ckpt from 50-step test), not your 1000-step run.

1. FIND THE CORRECT CHECKPOINT
   Run this to see all checkpoints with timestamps:

   dir checkpoints\masked /O-D

   Look for the most recent .ckpt file from your 1000-step run.

2. TEST GENERATION WITH CORRECT CHECKPOINT
   Replace [CHECKPOINT] with the actual filename:

   python sample_masked.py checkpoints\masked\[CHECKPOINT] --num-samples 2 --seq-len 64 --num-steps 30

3. IF OUTPUT IS STILL GARBAGE (expected at 1000 steps)
   Train longer with wikitext-103 for better results:

   python train_masked.py --dataset wikitext-103 --max-steps 5000 --batch-size 2 --accumulate 16

   This will take ~30-40 minutes but should produce more coherent output.

4. RESUME FROM EXISTING CHECKPOINT (optional)
   If you want to continue training from your 1000-step checkpoint:

   python train_masked.py --resume checkpoints\masked\[CHECKPOINT] --dataset wikitext-103 --max-steps 5000

EXPECTED QUALITY BY TRAINING STEPS:
- 1000 steps: Mostly garbage, some English words
- 3000 steps: Short phrases, still choppy
- 5000 steps: Coherent sentences starting to appear
- 10000+ steps: Good quality for paper

Let me know what the checkpoint situation looks like and we'll proceed from there.
